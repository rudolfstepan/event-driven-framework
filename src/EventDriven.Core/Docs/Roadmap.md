# Event-Driven Application Core - Roadmap

## Current Status

- Fully functional event-driven application core
- Modular, scalable, asynchronous
- Simulation Engine, Workflow Manager, Event Console
- Automated testing included
- Ready for real projects

## Next Steps

### 1. **Open Source Release**
- Clean up namespaces, structure for public consumption
- Choose a license (e.g., MIT, Apache 2.0)
- Create a public GitHub repository

### 2. **NuGet Package**
- Package EventCore into a lightweight NuGet library
- Optional Extensions:
  - EventBus Extensions (e.g., Delayed events, Retry policies)
  - View Frameworks (e.g., WinUI, MAUI, WPF integration)

### 3. **Sample Applications**
- Create simple demo apps for:
  - Desktop (WinUI, WPF)
  - Mobile (MAUI)
  - Server (ASP.NET Core API)

### 4. **Advanced Features (Optional)**
- Distributed EventBus support (e.g., over SignalR, RabbitMQ)
- Event Persistence (Durable Event Store)
- Live Event Monitoring Dashboard (Web Interface)

### 5. **Documentation Website**
- Build a documentation portal (e.g., GitHub Pages, ReadTheDocs)
- Include diagrams, tutorials, sample projects

### 6. **Community Involvement**
- Invite contributions
- Provide clear contribution guidelines (CONTRIBUTING.md)
- Offer easy entry points (Good First Issues, Help Wanted labels)
