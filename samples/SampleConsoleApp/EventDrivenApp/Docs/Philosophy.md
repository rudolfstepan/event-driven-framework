# The Philosophy Behind EVC (Event-View-Component)

## Why we move beyond MVVM and MVC

Traditional architectures like MVC and MVVM served an important purpose:
- Structuring logic
- Enabling unit testing
- Promoting separation of concerns

But the world has changed.

Modern applications require:
- More asynchrony
- Greater modularity
- Dynamic runtime behavior
- Loose coupling between parts
- Scalable workflows

## The Core Ideas of EVC

| Principle | Description |
|:--|:--|
| **Events as Language** | Events represent meaningful actions across the app. |
| **Views as Renderers** | Views are modular, self-activating responders to events. |
| **Components as Listeners** | Business logic becomes event-driven, reactive components. |
| **Loose Coupling** | No tight dependencies. Everything is orchestrated through topics. |
| **Dynamic Flows** | Application logic builds itself dynamically based on event chains. |

## Benefits of EVC

- **Pure Modularity** - Components can be added, removed, replaced without breaking the system.
- **Natural Scalability** - Scale horizontally through distributed event systems.
- **Superior Testability** - Test flows, not tightly coupled procedures.
- **Resilience** - The app continues even if some events are lost or delayed.
- **Ultimate Flexibility** - Build dynamic workflows without needing to predict every step beforehand.

## The Future We Build

EVC is not just another pattern.  
It is a **philosophy of design** that embraces:
- Asynchronous reality
- Dynamic business models
- Modular architectures
- Evolving requirements

It is about **building systems that flow like life itself**, not static castles made of brittle bricks.

Welcome to **EVC**.  
Welcome to **living architecture**.
