# LightweightEventBusAsync

**LightweightEventBusAsync** is a high-performance, memory-safe, thread-safe asynchronous event bus system for .NET applications.

It supports:
- **Weak references** through internal management (no manual unsubscribe required for GC'd objects)
- **Minimal locking** with concurrent collections
- **Direct delegate invocation** (no reflection slowdown)
- **Topic-based event separation**
- **Optional per-subscriber filters** for precise control
- **Automatic timestamps** via event envelopes

This makes it ideal for scenarios with many dynamic subscriptions, high-frequency event firing, and complex event-routing needs.

## Features

- **WeakReference-like memory safety**
- **Thread-safe** with concurrent dictionaries
- **Fast publish** with minimal overhead
- **Error tolerance**: Subscriber errors are caught individually
- **Per-subscriber filtering**
- **Timestamps on all events**
- **Simple and clean API**

---

## Getting Started

### 1. Create an instance
```csharp
var eventBus = new LightweightEventBusAsync();
```

### 2. Subscribe to an event (no filter)
```csharp
eventBus.Subscribe<string>(async envelope =>
{
    Console.WriteLine($"Received at {envelope.Timestamp}: {envelope.Payload}");
    return EventAcknowledge.Handled;
});
```

### 3. Subscribe with a filter
```csharp
eventBus.Subscribe<string>(async envelope =>
{
    Console.WriteLine($"Filtered: {envelope.Payload}");
    return EventAcknowledge.Handled;
},
filter: msg => msg.StartsWith("Hello"));
```

### 4. Publish an event
```csharp
await eventBus.PublishAsync("Hello from LightweightEventBusAsync!");
await eventBus.PublishAsync("Another message");
```

### 5. Unsubscribe from an event
```csharp
Func<EventEnvelope<string>, Task<EventAcknowledge>> handler = async envelope =>
{
    Console.WriteLine($"Will be removed: {envelope.Payload}");
    return EventAcknowledge.Handled;
};

// Subscribe
eventBus.Subscribe(handler);

// Later, unsubscribe
eventBus.Unsubscribe(handler);
```

## Advanced Example: Topics and Filters

Using custom topics with filters:

```csharp
public record TopicMessage(int TopicId);

// Subscribe only for TopicId == 42
eventBus.Subscribe<TopicMessage>(async envelope =>
{
    Console.WriteLine($"Topic 42 received at {envelope.Timestamp}: {envelope.Payload.TopicId}");
    return EventAcknowledge.Handled;
},
filter: msg => msg.TopicId == 42);

// Publish different topic messages
await eventBus.PublishAsync(new TopicMessage(42));   // Will be processed
await eventBus.PublishAsync(new TopicMessage(99));   // Will be ignored
```

---

## Internals

- Internally uses `ConcurrentDictionary<Type, IEventGroup>` for event separation.
- Each event type has its own group of subscriptions with optional filters.
- Publishing invokes only matched and alive subscribers.
- All events are wrapped in `EventEnvelope<T>`, containing the payload and timestamp.

---

## Benchmark

Compared to traditional event handlers:
- **Up to 10x faster** with mass subscriptions
- **No memory leaks** from forgotten unsubscriptions
- **Minimal CPU overhead** even under high event rates
